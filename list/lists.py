# someetime we want to store multiple types of data item in a single variable forr that we use list
# lists are mutable
marks = [54,56,46,76,58,90]
mixed=[43,"hello",False,4.22222]

# list can store multiple datatype item

print(mixed)

print(marks[0])

marks[0:2]#slicing also posible just like strings
marks [0] = 20
print(marks)#list are mutable it can change original list
